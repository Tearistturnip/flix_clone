The following **additional** user stories are implemented:
-[x] Alert has buttons with functionality to try refresh and fix the problem

   If there was a settings page, so the user could have more control. Change the coloring of the app/text.
   Any more of the optionals of course. 

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Understanding of the swift language to implement more features. Not exactly sure what happened during the videos.
2. How this app can be more social. Is there a way for the user to interact with the API for ratings and such.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
    It's difficult understanding what every part of the code is doing, but I assume that this will be less of a problem as I deal with more SWIFT code.
