# Project 1 - *flix_clone*

**Name of your app** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **4 1/2** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** user stories are complete:

- [x] User sees app icon in home screen and styled launch screen (+1pt)
- [x] User can scroll through a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie DB API (+5pt)
- [x] User can "Pull to refresh" the movie list (+2pt)
- [x] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies to load (+2pt)

The following **optional** user stories are implemented:

- [x] User sees an alert when there's a networking error (+1pt)
- [ ] User can search for a movie (+3pt)
- [ ] While poster is being fetched, user see's a placeholder image (+1pt)
- [ ] User sees image transition for images coming from network, not when it is loaded from cache (+1pt)
- [ ] Customize the selection effect of the cell (+1pt)
- [ ] For the large poster, load the low resolution image first and then switch to the high resolution image when complete (+2pt)

The following **additional** user stories are implemented:
-[x] Alert has buttons with functionality to try refresh and fix the problem

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality! (+1-3pts)
   If there was a settings page, so the user could have more control. Change the coloring of the app/text.
   Any more of the optionals of course. 

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Understanding of the swift language to implement more features. Not exactly sure what happened during the videos.
2. How this app can be more social. Is there a way for the user to interact with the API for ratings and such.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

Problem with gifs. They all showed up as question marks, so I decided to just have links. Apparently, on github, there's issues if the files are too big. I dont know if that was the issue, but they wouldn't show up despite having the right format. Sorry about the trouble. '

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
    It's difficult understanding what every part of the code is doing, but I assume that this will be less of a problem as I deal with more SWIFT code.
